## The PDB Database

The main repository of biomolecular structure data is called the [Protein Data Bank](https://www.rcsb.org/) (PDB for short). It is the second oldest database (after GenBank).

What is currently in the PDB? We can access current composition stats [here](https://www.rcsb.org/stats/).

```{r}
stats <- read.csv("Data Export Summary.csv", row.names = 1)
stats
```

> Q1: What percentage of structures in the PDB are solved by X-Ray and Electron Microscopy.

```{r}
x <- stats$X.ray

# Substitute comma for nothing
y <- (gsub(",", "", x))

#convert to numeric
sum(as.numeric(y))
```

Turn this snippet into a function so I can use it any time I have this comma problem (i.e. the other columns of this `stats` table)

```{r}
comma.sum <- function(x) {
  # Substitute comma for nothing
  y <- (gsub(",", "", x))
  
  # convert to numerica
  return(sum(as.numeric(y)))
}
```

```{r}
xray.sum <- comma.sum(stats$X.ray)
em.sum <- comma.sum(stats$EM)
total.sum <- comma.sum(stats$Total)
```

```{r}
xray.sum/total.sum * 100
```

```{r}
em.sum/total.sum * 100
```

```{r}
(em.sum + xray.sum)/total.sum * 100
```

> Q2: What proportion of structures in the PDB are protein?

```{r}
comma.sum(stats$Total[1]) / total.sum * 100
```

> Q3: Type HIV in the PDB website search box on the home page and determine how many HIV-1 protease structures are in the current PDB?

SKIPPED

## 2. Visualizing with Mol-star

Explore the HIV-1 protease structure with PDB code: `1HSG`
Mol-star homepage at: https://molstar.org/viewer/.

## 3. Using the bio3d package in R

The Bio3D package is focused on structural bioinformatics analysis and allows us to read and analyze PDB (and related) data. 

```{r}
library(bio3d)
```

```{r}
pdb <- read.pdb("1hsg")
pdb
```

```{r}
attributes(pdb)
```

We can see atom data with `pdb$atom`:

```{r}
head(pdb$atom)
```

```{r}
head(pdbseq(pdb))
```

## Molecular visualization in R

We can make quick 3D viz with the `view.pdb()` function:

```{r}
library(bio3dview)
library(NGLVieweR)

# view.pdb(pdb, backgroundColor = "lightblue", colorScheme = "sse") |>
  # setSpin()
```

```{r}
sel <- atom.select(pdb, resno=25)

# view.pdb(pdb, cols = c("green", "orange"), highlight = sel, highlight.style = "spacefill") |>
  # setRock()
```

## Predicting functional motions of a single structure

We can finish off today with a bioinformatics prediction of the functional motions of a protein. 

We will run a Normal Mode Analysis (NMA).

```{r}
adk <- read.pdb("6s36")
adk
```

```{r}
m <- nma(adk)
plot(m)
```

```{r}
# view.nma(m)
```

We can write out a trajectory of the predicted dynamics and view this in Mol-star. 

```{r}
mktrj(m, file = "nma.pdb")
```
