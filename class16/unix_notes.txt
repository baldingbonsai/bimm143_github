nano is a very basic text editor that is available everywhere. 

Some important unix cmds:

pwd: where are we in the file system 
cd: change dir 
ls: list the contents 
mkdir: make a new directory
rm: remove files and folders ** WARNING **
nano: text editors 
head: view top of file
tail: view bottom of file
less: page through a file

Useful shortcuts: 
The TAB key for autocomplete
The ~ for home area
The ../ for dropping to the parent directory (previous folder)
